# Face Mask Detection

## Overview
Face Mask Detection is a computer vision project aimed at detecting whether a person is wearing a face mask or not. The project utilizes deep learning techniques to classify faces into two categories: "With Mask" and "Without Mask." The motivation behind this project is to help enforce mask-wearing policies in public places and contribute to public health and safety during pandemics like COVID-19.

## Motivation
This project was motivated by the need to apply computer vision and deep learning techniques to a real-world problem. Face mask detection provides a practical use case for image classification and real-time detection, helping improve safety while demonstrating the effectiveness of AI in public health applications.
